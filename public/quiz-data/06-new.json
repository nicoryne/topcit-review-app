    "options": [
      "Lead time is for critical tasks, lag time is for non-critical tasks",
      "Lead time accelerates the successor activity, lag time delays the successor activity",
      "Lead time is measured in days, lag time is measured in hours",
      "Lead time applies to dependencies, lag time applies to milestones"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "In project scheduling, lead time is an acceleration or overlap of a successor activity (allows a successor activity to start before its predecessor finishes), represented as a negative number. Lag time is a delay imposed on a successor activity, represented as a positive number."
